Lightweight, **ECMA-6 Promise-based** module loader library supporting *ECMA-262 Revision 6**
 
For this to work you need to include a **ECMA-6 Promise shim** if your browser don't support it. It's recomended to use **hAzzle ECMA-6 Promise shim**, located here: https://github.com/hazzlejs/Promises
 
The **shim** has to be loaded *before* this library.

####NOTE!! The module system will be developed soon as I have time. Meanwhile this repo are just here as a placeholder
